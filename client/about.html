        <p>POLYSWEEPER - a two player competitive Minesweeper clone</p>
        <h3>RULES:</h3>
        <p>TIMED MODE: each player with their own board. Both player 1 and 2’s boards are displayed on either
            player’s screen, but each player can only interact with their own. The mine placements on both boards are
            identical, and both players must complete the board as fast as possible. Players can use the uncovered cells
            on their
            enemy’s board to their advantage to uncover cells.</p>
        <p>
            TURN BASED MODE – both players play on one board, taking turns to uncover cells. Points are calculated
            opposite
            to the regular game – they are gained by uncovering a cell with a mine. A player’s turn continues as
            long as they only press cells with mines in them. If an empty cell is discovered, the next player has
            their turn. Whoever has the most points once the board is completed wins. </p>
